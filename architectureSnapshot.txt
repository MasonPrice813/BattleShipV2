ARCHITECTURE SNAPSHOT – BATTLESHIP V2+

CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES (BROWSER)
- Displays the player board, enemy board, and battle log
- Allows the player to click a cell to fire a shot
- Sends player actions to the server using POST requests
- Disables input when it is not the player’s turn or the game is over
- Does not decide hits, misses, turns, or win conditions

SERVER RESPONSIBILITIES (PHP / XAMPP)
- Creates and stores both fleets
- Validates all shots (bounds, duplicates, correct turn)
- Determines hit, miss, and sunk results
- Runs the computer’s turn after the player fires
- Selects computer shots based on the chosen difficulty
- Checks for win and game over conditions
- Updates the battle log

WHERE GAME STATE LIVES
- All game state is stored in PHP sessions using $_SESSION["game"]
- This includes ship positions, hit/miss history, turn order, AI memory, and the battle log
- Because state is stored in the session, refreshing the page does not reset the game

STATE TRANSITIONS (SIMPLIFIED)
- Game starts → Player turn
- Player fires a shot → Server processes hit/miss
- If no winner → Computer turn
- Computer fires → Server processes hit/miss
- If no winner → Return to player turn
- If all ships are sunk → Game over
